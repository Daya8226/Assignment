# Java Server for Handling Properties Files

## Overview
This Java server program is designed to handle incoming properties files from multiple clients.
It listens for client connections, receives properties files, processes them, and saves the processed properties to disk.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later)
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE that supports Java projects)

### Import and Run in IntelliJ IDEA
1. Unzip the project on your machine at a specific directory path.
2. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Click on "File" -> "Open" and select the project directory.
4. IntelliJ IDEA will recognize the project and configure it automatically.
5. Take the Run menu -> Select Edit Configurations -> Add New Configuration -> Fill the Program arguments field.
   In Program arguments field, it is required to mention config file path including config file name
   For example: If the config file is placed directly in D Drive then mention it like D:\server-config.properties
   Do not copy paste in Program arguments field.
5. In the Project Explorer, locate the `Server.java` file.
6. Right-click on `Client.java` and choose "Run Client.main()" from the context menu.

## Configuration
1. Create a configuration file (e.g., `server-config.properties`) with the following content:

    # Server Configuration
    # Output directory to store processed properties files
    outputDirectory=D:\\ROC
    # Port to listen on
    port=80

2. The server will start listening on the specified port for incoming connections.

## Notes
- Ensure that the output directory exists, and the server has the necessary permissions to write to it.
- The server will process incoming properties files, saving them to the specified output directory.
